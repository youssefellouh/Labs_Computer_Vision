# ðŸ”Š Labs Computer Vision

**Description**  
Labs Computer Vision is a project dedicated to the exploration and implementation of computer vision techniques. This project contains various labs, examples, and demonstrations of image processing algorithms
## Project Structure
- lab1/ -  Includes the basic principles of camera calibration, using images of a grid or checkerboard to correct radial and tangential distortion errors, and to visualize the effect of calibration on images.
- lab2/- Focuses on fundamental concepts of epipolar geometry, including stereo vision and the relationship between corresponding points in stereo images. This lab explores the computation of fundamental and essential matrices.
- lab3/: Deals with Homographies. It includes working with transformations between images of the same scene taken from different perspectives, such as computing and applying homographies for image stitching .
